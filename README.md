#  Moonraker - API Web Server for Klipper

Moonraker is a Python 3 based web server that exposes APIs with which
client applications may use to interact with
[Klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper). Communcation between
the Klippy host and Moonraker is done over a Unix Domain Socket.  Tornado
is used to provide Moonraker's server functionality.

Documentation for users and developers can be found on
[Read the Docs](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Note that Moonraker does not come bundled with a client, you will need to
install one.  The following clients are currently available:
- [Mainsail](https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail) by Meteyou
- [Fluidd](https://github.com/cadriel/fluidd) by Cadriel
- [KlipperScreen](https://github.com/jordanruthe/KlipperScreen) by jordanruthe
